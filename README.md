Padiddle
========

Padiddle is the name of a game aimed quickly identifying cars with a burnt out headlight by punching the ceiling. The goal of this project is to create an easy to use hardware/software solution that facilitates the playing of padiddle in a vehicle. The design is composed of an Arduino Uno, two piezoelectric sensors to detect when a user punches the ceiling, and a custom PCB that acts as the user interface.
